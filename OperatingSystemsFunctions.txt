An operating system is an interface between a computer user and the hardware of the computer. The operating system is the software that helps to perform all the basic functions like file management, process management, memory management, handling the user input and controlling outside devices such as USB drives and printers. We need operating systems because they are the most important software that runs on a computer and allows you to speak with the computer without having to know how to speak the computer's language. 

Another function of the operating system is data security. This is important because it manages the confidentiality and availability of data the computer may or may not allow. Security helps to protect the computer's memory, disk, data, and programs on the system. It is very important to protect your information from attacks and to always have updated security program installed on your computer.
